# book-library
A book library where you can add, remove, and update books.

Hello, this is my 8th project here in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It's a book library where you can add remove and update the details of your favorite books. You can keep track of your book whether it's read or not read. The books will be saved in the browser's local storage and your books won't vanish after refreshing the browser.
